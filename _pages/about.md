**My ultimate vision is to empower individuals to create their own games and movies through accessible, powerful CV algorithms.** To realize this, my current research focuses on advancing computer vision in diverse domains, including food computing, 3D scene understanding, robotic action analysis, and sports analytics. My work spans the full spectrum of computer vision—from 2D and 3D perception to video understanding and generative modeling—pushing the boundaries of what intelligent visual systems can achieve.

## Work Experience and Education
I am a Research Assistant Professor at the [Vision and Image Processing Lab (VIP)](https://vip.uwaterloo.ca/) at the University of Waterloo, specializing in Computer Vision. I joined the VIP lab as a postdoctoral fellow under the supervision of [Professor Alexander Wong](https://uwaterloo.ca/systems-design-engineering/profile/a28wong) from 2020 to 2022, was promoted to Research Associate in 2022, and became a Research Assistant Professor in 2023. I earned my B.A.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Purdue University in 2015 and 2019, respectively, where I was a member of the [Video and Image Processing (VIPER) laboratory](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ips/), under the supervision of [Professor Edward J. Delp](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ace/). 

## Prospective Students/Postdocs
I'm looking for MASc/PhD students and Postdocs for Computer Vision in Construction. Candidates with background in SLAM, Nerf, Gaussian Splatting, Robotics are encouraged to apply.

Our lab is also looking for students in Remote Sensing, supervised by [Professor David Clausi](https://uwaterloo.ca/systems-design-engineering/profile/dclausi)
